## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL and select "Integration" as the category

2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Easy Setup - Just 2 Fields!

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for "Schluter DITRA-HEAT-E-RS1"
4. Enter your **Schluter account email and password**

6. Done!

**Your password is used once to generate a secure token and is never stored!**

**We automatically detect your locations - no need to find location IDs!**

Your thermostats will now appear as climate entities!

## Usage

### Available Entities

Each RS1 thermostat provides:

**Climate Entity:**
- `climate.{name}` - Thermostat control

**Sensor Entities:**
- `sensor.{name}_heating_output` - Current heating percentage (0-100%) from controller
- `sensor.{name}_heating_time_today` - Total hours of heating today (calculated)
- `sensor.{name}_gfci_status` - Safety monitoring from controller (ok/error)
- `sensor.{name}_estimated_power` - Estimated power consumption in Watts*

*Power is **estimated** based on heating % (from controller) × floor area (you configure). The RS1 controllers don't have built-in power meters. Accuracy: ±5-10%, sufficient for trends and automation.

### Basic Control

Each thermostat appears as a climate entity:
- `climate.kitchen_floor` (example)
- `climate.bathroom_floor` (example)

Control them like any other thermostat:
```yaml
service: climate.set_temperature
target:
  entity_id: climate.kitchen_floor
data:
  temperature: 22
```

### Preset Modes

**Home Mode** (manual, normal heating):
```yaml
service: climate.set_preset_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.kitchen_floor
data:
  preset_mode: home
```

**Away Mode** (reduced heating):
```yaml
service: climate.set_preset_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.kitchen_floor
data:
  preset_mode: away
```

**Schedule Mode** (follow programmed schedule):
```yaml
service: climate.set_preset_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.kitchen_floor
data:
  preset_mode: schedule
```

## Example Automations

### Morning Warmup
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning Bathroom Floor Warmup"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "06:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.workday_sensor
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: climate.bathroom_floor
        data:
          temperature: 24
```

### Time-of-Use Optimization
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Floor Heat: Reduce During On-Peak"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.tou_period
        to: "on_peak"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id:
            - climate.kitchen_floor
            - climate.bathroom_floor
        data:
          temperature: >
            {{ state_attr(trigger.entity_id, 'temperature') - 2 }}
```

### Smart Away Mode
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Floor Heat: Away When Nobody Home"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: zone.home
        to: "0"
        for: "00:30:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: all
        data:
          preset_mode: away
```

### Weather-Based Pre-Heat
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Floor Heat: Cold Day Boost"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: weather.home
        attribute: temperature
        below: 0
    action:
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id:
            - climate.kitchen_floor
            - climate.bathroom_floor
        data:
          temperature: >
            {{ state_attr(trigger.entity_id, 'temperature') + 1 }}
```

## Available Attributes

Each climate entity provides these attributes:

- `current_temperature` - Current floor temperature
- `target_temperature` - Target temperature
- `hvac_action` - heating/idle/off
- `preset_mode` - home/away/schedule
- `setpoint_mode` - manual/schedule
- `heating_percent` - Current heating output (0-100%)
- `gfci_status` - GFCI safety status
- `air_floor_mode` - Sensor type (air/floor)

## Dashboard Card Example

```yaml
type: thermostat
entity: climate.kitchen_floor
name: Kitchen Floor
```

Or use a custom card for more details:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Floor Heating
entities:
  - entity: climate.kitchen_floor
    type: custom:simple-thermostat
    control:
      - hvac
      - preset
  - entity: climate.bathroom_floor
    type: custom:simple-thermostat
    control:
      - hvac
      - preset
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid authentication" error
- Check that your email and password are correct
- Try logging into schluterditraheat.com to verify credentials

### "Cannot connect" error
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Schluter API is accessible (try visiting schluterditraheat.com)

### "No devices found" error
- Verify your Location ID is correct
- Make sure you have thermostats configured in your Schluter account

### Integration doesn't appear
- Make sure you restarted Home Assistant after installation
- Check the logs for any error messages

### Integration requires reauthentication
- Your session has expired (happens every 30-90 days)
